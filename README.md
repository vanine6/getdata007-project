getdata007-project
==================

Repository for the Coursera getdata-007 course project.  

The project consists of a R script named run_analysis and a data set structured in a base directory in the same organization of the reference for the project in terms of sub-directory names and file names. This base directory is a parameter for the run_analysis function.

In the script file, there is a function called read_merge_train_test which receives two file names (corresponding to train and test), read these files and merge them returning a data frame with the merged files.
